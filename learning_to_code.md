##Intro
So I am hiring again for my venture 100x(the name is crap, I know. Its a working title). Web developers are in high demand, the higher the level the higher the demand.

//If you ever read the rough draft of my book, [Ship Or Get Off The Pot](), you can

I have had great success taking young untested but highly motivated and intellegent people with very little if any training in web development and have trained them up to become profeccient junior developers in a very short time. This isn't to say that eventually they couldn't become senior developers or even reach a web app architect level, that just takes alot more time and expiremnce.




This post is intended to guid a user from zero coding but a fundemental knowladge of how to turn on a computer, browse the internet and use a text editor to basic professicency in the MEAN stack.

###The M.E.A.N. stack:
The MEAN Stack is a combination of web languages and frameworks both serverside and browser side that, when put together, allow developers to rapidly build and scale the web applications you use everyday.


####Mongo Database: 
A NoSQL or non relational database. The syntax for interacting with MongoDB is similar to JavaScript.

####ExpressJS:
Express is a web server framework that runs on NodeJS. Its a highly customizable serverside(sometimes referd to as "Backend" framework.

####Angular JS:
Angular is a browser side or "frontend" framework for building interactive applications that have advanced functionality that runs in the browser.

####Node JS:
NodeJS is an extreamly flexable 


_This is kind of redundant being as you need NodeJS to run express but I guess 'M.E.A. stack' does not have the same ring to it_

##How to start:

###Step 1:

Open a text editor on your computer. You can use the default but I recomend one of the following:

* Notepad++
* Sublime

On your desktop create a file called **index.html**

Copy and paste the following into **index.html**

```
<html>
    <head>
        <title>My test web app</title>

    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Hello World</h1>
    </body>
</html>
```

Save the file then open the file in your browser of choice.

_I strongly recomend [Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome/)_

####What is HTML:
A long time ago when the internet was first starting out and no one ever dreamed we would have fancy realtime updating applications like Facebook, Youtube, and Twitter developers just wanted a way to create an share documents through the browser.

They took an existing language [XML or EXtensible Markup Language](http://www.w3schools.com/xml/
) and created a specilized version of it to run in these new things called browsers. That specialized form of XML was [HTML or Hypertext Markup Language](http://www.w3schools.com/html/).

#####XML:
XML is meirly a syntax. Computers are not incredibly smart so you have to give it very specific directions.

I would NOT bother to go through the tutorials on W3 but I would make it a point to understand how XML works.



#####HTML:

History - xml - html - 

The DOM - A living breathing thing
HTML is just a blueprint


####Notes on asset paths:

Say for example you are editing the following web page: `http://mywebsite.com/dir1/dir2/page.html`

`<img src="image.jpg">` Would open `http://mywebsite.com/dir1/dir2/page.html`

`<img src="/image.jpg">` Would open `http://mywebsite.com/page.html`

`<img src="/dir3/image.jpg">` Would open `http://mywebsite.com/dir3/page.html`

`<img src="http://otherwebiste.com/image.jpg">` Would open `http://otherwebiste.com/image.jpg`

Now assuming you are on an https `<img src="//otherwebiste.com/image.jpg">` Would open `https//otherwebiste.com/image.jpg` . It will look at the protocol that the currently loaded web page is on and use that.



###Step 3:
