##Intro
So I am hiring again for my venture 100x(the name is crap, I know. Its a working title). Web developers are in high demand, the higher the level the higher the demand.

//If you ever read the rough draft of my book, [Ship Or Get Off The Pot](), you can

I have had great success taking young untested but highly motivated and intellegent people with very little if any training in web development and have trained them up to become profeccient junior developers in a very short time. This isn't to say that eventually they couldn't become senior developers or even reach a web app architect level, that just takes alot more time and expiremnce.




This post is intended to guid a user from zero coding but a fundemental knowladge of how to turn on a computer, browse the internet and use a text editor to basic professicency in the MEAN stack.

###The M.E.A.N. stack:
The MEAN Stack is a combination of web languages and frameworks both serverside and browser side that, when put together, allow developers to rapidly build and scale the web applications you use everyday.


####Mongo Database: 
A NoSQL or non relational database. The syntax for interacting with MongoDB is similar to JavaScript.

####ExpressJS:
Express is a web server framework that runs on NodeJS. Its a highly customizable serverside(sometimes referd to as "Backend" framework.

####Angular JS:
Angular is a browser side or "frontend" framework for building interactive applications that have advanced functionality that runs in the browser.

####Node JS:
NodeJS is an extreamly flexable 


_This is kind of redundant being as you need NodeJS to run express but I guess 'M.E.A. stack' does not have the same ring to it_

##How to start:

###Step 1:

Open a text editor on your computer. You can use the default but I recomend one of the following:

* Notepad++
* Sublime

On your desktop create a file called **index.html**

Copy and paste the following into **index.html**

```
<html>
    <head>
        <title>My test web app</title>

    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Hello World</h1>
    </body>
</html>
```

Save the file then open the file in your browser of choice.

_I strongly recomend Chrome_


History - xml - html - 

The DOM - A living breathing thing
HTML is just a blueprint

###Step 3:
W 3 Schools HTML 

###Step 4:

#####Async:

#####Scope/Closures:



###Step 5:
Learn a framework - Bootstrap

Your probablly sick of your work looking like crap


###Step 7:
Learn a bad ass framework, Angular



####Basic app setup

####Modules

####HTML binding

####Directives

###Step 8:
Backend  Node - Basics

(Not a web server)


Running a script from command line

Require a script

###Step 9:
